### Introduction  
***Party Sign-up Sheet*** is a hobby / practice project to create a sign-up sheet for people like me & my housemate who host potluck parties often. The app is build with Java Spring Framework and deployed on Heroku. The sign-up sheet provides basic functions to add and modify the party attendees' info, and also provides deletion for the administrator.
